In this project you have to create a basic 2D game in which a
dolphin escapes from planet Earth after eating fish.
Instead of a dolphin, fish and Earth, you can use any character, items and scenery you want.


Bonus :

If you put M in the map of .txt, It will add monster that can kill the player and make him lose. 

The total of the movements done in the game are directly printed in the top left of the window.
